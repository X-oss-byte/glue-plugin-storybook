<Meta title="Overview/GoalsAndNonGoals" />

## Goals

- Universal CSS-in-JS solution (implementation per platform can differ)
- Consistent API for developers
- Solve CSS Specificity
- TypeScript everything
- Styling for
  - Theme / token
  - Variants
  - Media Queries
  - States
  - Platform based styling
  - Color Mode
- Composable (should work with other libraries)

## Non goals

- Don’t solve problems beyond styling!
- Accessibility (check universa11y.dev)
- Design (check gluestack-ui)
- Animation (check examples with Legend-Motion)

## Under consideration (not a roadmap)

- Dank to support other libraries & frameworks — Solid, Svelte, Vue, Astro or Qwik
- Bundler plugin (instead of the babel-plugin)
  - To generate separate CSS files
  - To remove intermediate components when it makes sense

## Gotchas

Though this is internal to the library, it’s great if you know the following:

- Dank generates pure CSS for media-queries
- media-query color-mode-preferences isn’t supported right now.
- Dank generates CSS classes & declarations for the rest. It doesn’t use the default CSS’s way of handling pseudo states. For eg, we don’t use CSS pseudo selector like `:hover`, the hover logic is left to the developer to implement in the JS runtime. The primary reason for that is to have a better control of user interactions and handle it with logic whenever needed (like to use Legend-Motion in the hover state).

Dank generates indepedent CSS class declarations for the following in the correct “order of specificity” after “resolving the theme tokens”. - Variants - States (hover, focus, …) - Color Mode
